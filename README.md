## App Name: 
Daily Task Manager
## Description: 
* Daily Task Manager is a minimalist Single Page Application that helps users manage their everyday tasks.
* It allows for the quick creation, viewing, updating, and deletion of tasks, with all data stored in a database.
* I wanted to make this app because many people including myself have a hard time keeping up on our daily tasks this app will help out those in need.
## User Story:
As a busy individual, I struggle to keep track of the many tasks I need to accomplish for work, school, and my personal life. My current methods of using the notes app or trying to remember everything mentally often fail, leading to missed deadlines and unnecessary stress. This disorganization makes me feel overwhelmed and unproductive. I need a simple, reliable, and secure digital tool where I can quickly capture all my to-dos in one place, ensuring that nothing important gets forgotten, and I can regain control over my daily schedule.

The Daily Task Manager is the perfect solution, providing a clean and focused interface to manage my responsibilities effectively. By creating a personal account, I can securely log in and instantly add new tasks as they arise, preventing them from slipping my mind. As I progress through my day, I can mark items as complete, giving me a clear sense of accomplishment, or delete tasks that are no longer relevant. This application transforms my chaotic mental checklist into an organized action plan, increasing my productivity and providing the peace of mind that comes with knowing my day is fully under control.
